## should have a few experiences/pages
1) selling a bike with the tile format - (for now adapting google tile favella experience) can be found here by clicking tile icon in bottom left https://beyondthemap.withgoogle.com/en-us/beyond-the-map/rio
2) youtube how to's 
```
- clean bike - spin to win vs grinding - bike fits - mountain biking - road racing 
- road groups - mtb groups - your next bike upgrade - clean your bike! - send me videos(contact us)
```
3) lets get social, share your experiences as you have them<br/>
a. throw up ephemeral pictures to be voted on.<br/>
b. cool places you have been "this is a cool place" - example Naples, FL has a cool bike bar with coffee beers.

## Each of these are wep pages on their own, they could be served at random or navigated between.
They also can be printed out with a print page!

Turned into a banner. And put as a booth in the store. ðŸ”¥

This will help you sell bikes.

This will help you gain trust with shoppers.

Jacksonville bikers will have cool tech.

4) What discussion is hot at the bike shop ?

5) A final page: 
<br/>sign up for the michael charity page. I like to buy people in my area random cool gadgets like tirewiz tire pressure monitors. click yes, for a chance for me to buy you something I have been buying for myself lately.<br/></br>
<b/>I have run out of things to upgrade for myself so now I buy other people upgrades. usually in the 100 dollar range.<b/><br/>
a. tire wiz<br/>
b. apple air tag + 3d printed bottle mount.<br/>
c. cycling computer<br/>
d. garmin power meter pedals<br/>

f. random thing that pops into my head.<br/><br/>
It might be fun to get people things that make sense as a next upgrade.<br/>
Do you have a computer that can handle video rendering, then gopro or skydio seems a good next step<br/><br/>
want to join in on the random charity page?<br/>
I offer full transparency<br/>

5) My favotite sites and sources of information
