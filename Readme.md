## Make bike shops better:
This project aims to provide signs with qr codes to bike shops that will empowers customers to ask bike mechanics better questions. The mechanics know a lot about biking information are usually passionate about their trade; But often it is hard for the mechanics to get the customers to ask the right questions. Hopefully project will help customers to get excited about buying a bike and ask the right questions to get the best bike for them. From that point on the project will serve as a resource to help them on the learning journey to progress to different biking levels.

1) buying a bike
2) learning about biking through videos
3) find cool biking trails, bike riding groups, bike shops, and coffee shops.
